# Design Exploration for Graph Partitioning into Triangles

Implementation of **three different solutions** for the **Graph Partition Into Triangles** problem.

## Reference

- **Problem description and complexity:** https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00224-012-9412-5  
- The problem asks whether the vertex set of a given graph can be partitioned into disjoint 3-cliques (triangles). It is **NP-complete**.

## What is in this repo

- Three distinct approaches (e.g. exact, heuristic, or ILP-based) to solve or approximate the problem.
- Code to run on sample or custom graphs.
- Brief comparison or notes on when each method is preferable (if documented in the repo).

## How to run

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Build and run each solution as described in the project (e.g. Makefile or README in subfolders).
3. Provide input graphs in the format expected by the code (e.g. edge list or adjacency matrix).
